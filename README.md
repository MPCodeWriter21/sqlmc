## Overview
SQLMC (SQL Injection Massive Checker) is a tool designed to scan a domain for SQL
injection vulnerabilities. It crawls the given URL up to a specified depth, checks
each link for SQL injection vulnerabilities, and reports its findings.

## Features
- Scans a domain for SQL injection vulnerabilities
- Crawls the given URL up to a specified depth
- Checks each link for SQL injection vulnerabilities
- Reports vulnerabilities along with server information and depth

## Installation
1. Clone the repository and run the `setup.py` to install:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/MPCodeWriter21/sqlmc
    cd sqlmc
    python setup.py install
    ```

## Usage

Run `sqlmc` with the following command-line arguments:

- `-u, --url`: The URL to scan (required)
- `-d, --depth`: The depth to scan (required)
- `-o, --output`: The output file to save the results

Example usage:

```bash
sqlmc -u http://example.com -d 2
```

Replace http://example.com with the URL you want to scan and 3 with the desired depth of
the scan. You can also specify an output file using the -o or --output flag followed by
the desired filename.

The tool will then perform the scan and display the results.

## TODO

- [ ] Check for multiple GET parameters.
- [ ] Better injection checker trigger methods
